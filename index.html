        <p>I was born in Kerala, India. </p>
    <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in 2011 from Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala, India, in the field of Electronics and Communication. At the age of 22, I migrated to Germany to study Microsystems Engineering at the University of Freiburg. During my master studies, I worked as a research assistant in Fraunhofer ISE. My job centered around investigating the variation in the surface topology of large solar concentrators. I also worked as a teaching assistant in the Laboratory for the Design of Microsystems at IMTEK. In November 2013, I joined the Laboratory for Microactuators as a research assistant where I completed my master's degree with the thesis in "performance comparison and long-term stability of tunable lenses" in 2014. In July 2015 I started working on my PhD thesis at the Laboratory for Microactuators, where I work in a DFG funded project. My thesis deals with the development of adaptive mirror elements for the applications in the field of femtosecond lasers. For more details, check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/binalbruno/" target="_blank">research details in linkedin</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=dhUjGYoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">publications</a>.</p>
    <p> While working on my PhD thesis, I also taught/assisted in undergrad lectures on Micro-actuators, Project management, and Sensors & Actuators. I also held the responsibilty for maintaining various equipments in the lab, including UV structuring laser, Laser profilometer, Microscopes, CNC Mill, Lathe, and also held the position as the network admin. Currently I am working as a process development Engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH.</p>

        <p>When I am not working, I will be usually spending time with my wife and my two kids. But here and there I always try to find some time for myself. I love to spend countless hours deep inside my moderate collection of non-fiction books. Ocassional science-fiction is tolerated. I usually spend the rest of my free-time playing Badminton, and having board-game nights with my friends. The recent pandemic and the resulting lockdown put a pause to that. In the extra free time I got, I tried to wet my feet in the world of Astrophotography, which really pushed my problem-solving skills to the next level.
